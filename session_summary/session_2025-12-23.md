# Session Summary: 2025-12-23
**Total Daily Time:** ~1.5 Hours

## 🎯 Goals Achieved
- **Git Integration:** Merged `feature/password-manager` into `main`.
- **Repository Hygiene:**
    - Performed `git fetch --prune` to remove stale remote pointers.
    - Verified branch statuses with `git branch -vv`.
    - Deleted redundant local branches (`ui-modification`, `feature/password-manager`).
- **Enhanced Search UI Overhaul:**
    - **Fluid Suggestions:** Smooth slide/fade entry for search results.
    - **Aura Focus Glow:** Color-coded (Google/Gemini) "breathing" aura when focused.
    - **Iconic Transitions:** 3D flip-rotate animation when swapping search modes.
- **Educational Knowledge Base:**
    - Updated `GitNotes.md` with "Cloud Cleanup" and "Status Dashboard" commands.
    - Explained the "Three Copies" concept (Local vs. GitHub vs. Bookmark).
    - Configured and documented **Global Auto-Prune** (`git config --global fetch.prune true`).

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- **Pruning:** `fetch --prune` is necessary to keep the local "address book" of remote branches in sync with GitHub when branches are deleted via PRs.
- **Branch Relationships:** A parent branch (`main`) will appear as "merged" into its child branch because the child contains the parent's entire history.
- **Git Status Dashboards:** `git branch -vv` and `git branch -a` are the primary tools for diagnosing sync issues between local and remote environments.

## 📁 File Changes
- **Modified:** `search.css`, `search.js`, `GitNotes.md`, `FEATURE_HISTORY.md`, `README.md`.
- **Merged:** `feature/password-manager` work is now safe on `main`.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- **New Feature:** Proceed to "Confidential Notes" or "Weather Widget" as planned.
- **Cleanup:** Continue to maintain strict branching hygiene for all future features.
