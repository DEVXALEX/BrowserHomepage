## 12. Password Manager Refinements & Inline Unlock
**Date:** 2025-12-20 | **Time:** 23:30

### 🔐 What Was Added
Refined the Password Manager with a "Locked Focus Mode" and smoother inline unlocking.

### ✨ Features
- **Locked Mode Visibility:** When locked, the sidebar (search, filters, logo) and header are hidden, focusing attention solely on the unlock screen.
- **Inline Unlock:** Replaced the modal popup with a clean, inline PIN input field directly on the locked view.
- **UI Polish:** 
  - Added visual underline to the active "Passwords" navbar link.
  - Converted "Lock Vault" sidebar button to a larger, centered icon-only button.
  - Removed unwanted gaps in the layout.

### 📁 Files Modified
- **JS:** 
  - `locker.js`: Updated to return boolean status (Success/Fail) for headless unlocking; added null checks.
  - `passwordManager.js`: Implemented `handleInlineUnlock` and `renderLockedState` logic; removed modal dependency.
  - `githubSync.js`: Fixed duplicate function causing sync badge issues.
- **CSS:** `passwords.css`: Added `.locked-mode` styles to hide sidebar/header; styled inline PIN input.
- **HTML:** `passwords.html`: Updated locked section structure.

### 🐛 Bugs Fixed
- **Unlock Failure:** Fixed communication breakdown between `locker.js` (which was returning void) and `passwordManager.js` (which expected boolean).
- **Sync Badge**: Deleted duplicate `updateStatus` method that was preventing the cloud sync badge from updating.

### ✅ Verified Working
- Vault locks and hides sidebar/header navigation.
- Inline PIN entry correctly unlocks the vault and restores the full dashboard.
- Active link in navbar is clearly visible.
