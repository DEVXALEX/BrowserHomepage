# Session Summary - December 18, 2025

## 🎯 Goals Achieved
1.  **Git Education**: Deep dive into Git mechanics.
    -   Explained `git fetch` vs `git pull`.
    -   Clarified Git pointers (`HEAD`, `origin/main`).
    -   Established the "Golden Rule" of branching first.
    -   Covered advanced topics like `rebase` and `abort`.
2.  **Documentation**:
    -   Significantly expanded `gitNotes.md` into a usable field guide.
3.  **Repository Cleanup**:
    -   Removed `backup_v1`, `optional-features`, and `style.css.bak` to reduce clutter.
    -   Created `session_summary/` directory to organize logs.
4.  **Secure Token Storage**:
    -   Implemented client-side encryption for GitHub Tokens (`AES-GCM`).
    -   Created shared `js/modules/crypto.js` module.
    -   Refactored `locker.js` and `githubSync.js` to use the Secure Vault.

## 📝 Key Learnings
-   **Fetch vs Pull**: Fetch is safe (preview), Pull is action (merge).
-   **Rebase**: Use `git pull --rebase` for a linear history when you haven't pushed yet.
-   **Abort**: `git rebase --abort` is the "Undo" button when things go wrong.
-   **Branching**: Always create a branch *before* touching files to avoid "detached head" or dirty working tree states.
-   **Security**: Plain text storage is bad. Encryption with a session-based PIN is a solid "middle ground" for local apps.
-   **Git Log**: `git log -n 5 --oneline` is the best way to quickly check recent history.

## 📁 File Changes
-   `m:\BrowserHomepage-main\gitNotes.md`: +100 lines of documentation.
-   `m:\BrowserHomepage-main\backup_v1\`: DELETED.
-   `m:\BrowserHomepage-main\optional-features\`: DELETED.
-   `m:\BrowserHomepage-main\session_summary\`: CREATED.

## 🔜 Next Steps
-   Practice the **Branching Workflow** on a real issue.
-   Practice the **Branching Workflow** on a real issue.
-   Explore other security enhancements (e.g. self-destructing secrets?).
