# Session Summary: 2025-12-22
**Total Daily Time:** ~10.5 Hours (1.25h Morning + 9.25h Evening)

## 🌅 Session 1: Morning (10:00 - 11:15)
- **Focus:** Password Manager Light Theme (Initial Implementation).
- **Achievements:**
    - Resolved persistent CSS caching issues.
    - Implemented **Separate Page Strategy** (`passwords-light.html`).
    - Standardized password masking (10 Orange Dots).

## 🌙 Session 2: Evening (12:25 - 21:30)
- **Focus:** Reversion, Security Hardening & Troubleshooting.
- **🎯 Goals Achieved:**
    - **Reversion:** Cleanly reverted dynamic theme toggle to a stable file-based navigation system.
    - **Bug Fixes:** 
        - Resolved "Session Locked" and "Unlock Failed" errors in `githubSync.js`.
        - Fixed critical initialization error where `initNavbar`, `githubSync.init`, and `Locker.init` were being skipped.
        - Restored missing script dependencies (`storage.js`, `crypto.js`, `navbar.js`) lost during file swapping.
    - **Documentation:**
        - Updated `README.md` with a comprehensive **Tech Stack** overview.
        - Consulted on Git branching (Graph visualization, Reflog, Parent-branch identification).
    - **Verification:**
        - Fixed navbar redirections.
        - Verified "Incorrect Master Password" messaging.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- **Initialization Dependencies:** When using modular JS without a bundler, the order of `<script>` tags and the completeness of the initialization sequence are brittle points of failure.
- **Git Investigation:** `git log --graph` and `git reflog` are indispensable for reconstructing branch history when parents are unclear.
- **Separate Page Architecture:** Confirmed that separate HTML files are the most reliable way to handle high-contrast theme changes (Light/Dark) in a static site environment.

## 📁 File Changes
- **Modified:** `passwords.html`, `passwords-dark.html`, `README.md`, `js/modules/passwordManager.js`, `js/modules/githubSync.js`, `GitNotes.md`, `FEATURE_HISTORY.md`.
- **Created:** `verify-hex.js` (Debugging helper).

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Merge `feature/security-hardening` into `feature/password-manager-UI`.
- Final verification of "Auto-Lock" functionality.
- Begin "Confidential Notes" implementation once stability is confirmed.
