# Session Summary: 2025-12-22
**Time:** 10:00 - 11:15
**Focus:** Password Manager Light Theme (Debugging & Implementation)

## 🎯 Goals Achieved
- Resolved persistent CSS caching/specificity issues with the theme toggle.
- Implemented a robust **Separate Page Strategy** for Light Mode.
- Created `passwords-light.html` with a dedicated **High-Contrast Orange Theme**.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Standardized password masking to **10 Orange Dots** for privacy.
    - Implemented **Card Design**: Cream Orange Cart (`#fff3cd`) + White/Orange Input (`#ffcc80`) + Dark Orange Borders.
    - Reverted text to Black/Grey for readability.
- Verified seamless navigation between Dark and Light modes.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- **CSS Specificity Strategy:** When `!important` and cache busting fail, dynamic class toggling can be fragile against aggressive browser caching.
- **Separate Page Architecture:** Creating a distinct HTML file (`passwords-light.html`) is a reliable fallback when JS-based internal styling fights with external CSS loading. It guarantees a clean state.
- **Git Hygiene:** Verified `git status` usage and updated documentation.

## 📁 File Changes
- **New Files:**
    - `passwords-light.html`: The Light Mode interface.
    - `css/pages/passwords-light.css`: Dedicated stylesheet for light theme overrides.
- **Modified:**
    - `passwords.html`: Removed broken JS toggle; added `<a>` link to light page.
    - `js/modules/passwordManager.js`: Removed complexity (toggle logic) to simplify maintenance.
    - `FEATURE_HISTORY.md`: Documented the new feature.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Verify user feedback on the "Separate Page" experience.
- Consider implementing a similar pattern for other pages if Light Mode is requested globally.
